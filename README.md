# Distantly Smooth Fluid

![](demo.gif)

## How to build
Don't even try it, the setup is a mess right now :(.

Why?
This is just a JavaScript + ClayGL renderer interfacing with the actual fluid simulation compiled from Rust to Web Assembly, the setup isn't as straightforward as one would hope for.

As I have spent enough time in this project and I should actually be working on my thesis, so no proper easy setup for now, even if it hurts me to not do it.

After my thesis I will come back here, I promise!
